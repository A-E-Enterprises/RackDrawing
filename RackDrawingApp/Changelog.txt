[fixed] Change SaveAs icon, it was the same as copy icon

UserLayout_362
[fixed] Set 60 as BTBDistance minimum value, if BTBDistance is equal 60 then all racks should be flush. All old version documents(without BTBDistance) will have 200 as BTBDistance value on open. All new version docs have 250 as BTBDistance default value.
